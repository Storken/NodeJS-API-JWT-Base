## Base for cookie authenticated user API using JWT and NodeJS
This project is a barebone api built with nodejs for quick and simple integration for your new projects.

Fork it, do whatever you need, it is meant to be a starting point with authentication implemented.

## Authentication
Authentication is done using JWT and slapping that token onto a cookie which we can read during the whole user session.
